# LCD's optimized checks file - v1.4.4-BETA
# For Matrix Premium 4.8.4
#
# This project aims to keep a balance between
# preventing false positives and having a
# strict anticheat that detects hacks quickly.
#
# Tested and meant for survival and minigame
# servers. Tweak the config for your own server!
#
# WARNING: If you are trying to use this on the
# free version of Matrix, it won't work, and
# most likely will crash the plugin.

      # You can customize the sensitivity of click Check, which is divided into three levels (0, 1, 2)
      # 0: It can detect many types of KillAura, but there are many false alarms. It is generally not recommended to use it
      # 1: Medium sensitivity, with a small number of false positives, it can detect most types of killaura

## HitBox
# Description: This check prevents players from using HitBox, Angle, Reach hacks.
# Note: This check is strict ONLY when you attack other PLAYERS, but it's very loose
# when you attack non-player creatures. So, if you find that you can use HixBox
# hack on non-player creatures, it's very normal, don't report it.
hitbox:
  # Enable HitBox check?
  enable: true

  # Maximum reach distance (default config: 3.1)
  # The standard/max Minecraft reach is 3.5 blocks, however it's still calculated in a mysterious way so most people won't even get near that.
  # So, based on all of this info, anything bigger then 3.4 blocks is considered hacks.
  # A lot of people requested to make this more strict. There you go.
  # I won't make it 3.1, but other options are more strict which should make things work fine.
  max_reach: 3.2

  # How many moves should the Matrix trace back to the player? (default: 5)
  # You can set this higher to reduce false positives, but this will weaken HitBox detection
  # My suggestion is 3 to 10, please don't make it more than 10, because it is useless

  # With the max reach this should be more stable, so the detection can be more strict.
  trace_back_length: 3

  # How much should Matrix ignore players with greater network latency?
  # When the player's network latency is greater than this value, some
  # HitBox checks will stop working to prevent false positives. You can
